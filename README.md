# TextEditor
A text editor made using JavaFX

Plans include ability to choose the name of the file you save, ability to input files, and a STE command line for changing settings within the application.

In later releases the prepackaged jar file will be included for ease of installation.

Current Progress: Can type or delete characters from the screen, Can save text to document named "SophDoc.txt" using a key combo of CTR-TAB

NOTE: This application is for educational purposes only. Vim is what you want, trust me.
